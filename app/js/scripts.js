// one gameBoard… use module
// write a function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage

// one display controller… use moule

// multiple players … use factories

// build the funcitons that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board,
// and then tie it to the DOM, lettin gplayers click on the gameboard to place their marker
// don’t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken
// think carefully about where each bit of logic should reside. each little piece of functinaltiy should
// be able to fit in the game, player, or gameboard objects… but take care to put them in “logical” places

// build the logic that checks for when the game is over!
// should check for 3 in a row and a tie

// clean up the interface to allow players to put intheir names,
// include a button to start/ restart the game
// and add a display element that congratulates the winning player
